# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Components

This web application utilizes Moment.js in order to get the current day an hour. As the hours go by through the day, the scheduler will grey out past hours, mark the current hour, and highlight future hours.

This application also utilizes the jQuery library.

FontAwesome was used to insert the save button icons and give a better user experience.

## Usage

With this application, the user can schedule different tasks for each hour of the day which are automatically saved to local storage upon clicking the save button. This is so that upon page refresh, the saved tasks will still be there. The application is also user friendly in that it highlights the current hour and task without needing any user input.
